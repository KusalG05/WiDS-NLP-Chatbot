Hey guys, here's the final code.

There are some blanks in the code, which you have to fill to complete it. You will be able to view the expected output for some blocks of code, so write your code accordingly.

Depending on what platform you're using (Colab, Jupyter, etc) and your system properties, you may have to download some dependencies and libraries. But don't worry; most of them get resolved with a 'pip install <library>' in the terminal window.

For submitting, you'll have to upload your completed notebooks onto github. Fork this repository and add your notebooks once completed. 

Add the report as well once it's done.

Please reach out in case of any sort of doubts, I'm very happy to resolve them. :)

In your report, just attach the link to your github repo at the end, no need to show the entire code in the report.
