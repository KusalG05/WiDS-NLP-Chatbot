# Winter in Data Science 2022 - Conversational Chatbot using NLP

Hi guys! Welcome to the github repo for this project.

All weekly agendas and further material required will be updated here, besides any quick notices through whatsapp. So do visit this page regularly to stay up to date!

### Documentation of work

For the successful completion of this project, a small report (a documentation of sorts) will be required. It is highly recommended that you start writing down your progress and learning as you progress each week, so it will be easier to compile your report at the end. You will also have to present a code walk-through where you explain all the aspects of your code - what you have done and why you did it.

Good luck everyone! Hoping you enjoy and benefit from this project. :)

You can view the week-wise content through the respective folders.

[Week 1](./week1/)
[Week 2](./week2/)
